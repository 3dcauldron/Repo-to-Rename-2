## About
A Django 1.10 Project Built off of [Django React Boilerplate](https://github.com/vintasoftware/django-react-boilerplate) that incorporates a few more helpful libraries and tools like:

- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API development
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for easy installation
- [Allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth) for secure user authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A copy of Docker or Docker toolbox, found [here](https://www.docker.com/get-docker).

### Installing

- Clone or download project to local repo
- navigate to root of project in command line (cd repo-to-rename)
- run "docker-compose up " to run Django and Postgres containers
- run "docker-compose stop" to stop containers and "docker-compose start" to start them back up again
- run "docker-compose build" to rebuild after making changes

By default, "docker-compose up" will begin the django development server on 0.0.0.0:8000. Navigate there with your web browser to confirm installation.
